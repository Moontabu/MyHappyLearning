1.1. Motivation

### 动机
<!--
I am not really skilled when it comes to art, so whenever I have tried to make a game one of the most difficult tasks that I have encountered has been the texture creation process. Even though we can get textures for free from different websites, most of the time you do not find exactly what you were looking for, so I end up discovering procedural texture generation.
-->  

我并不擅长美术，所以每当我尝试着创造一款游戏时，我所遇到的最困难的任务便是纹理创造过程。尽管我们可以从不同的网站免费获得贴图资源，但大多数时候你并不能找到你想要的，所以我最终发现了纹理程序生成  

<!--
There are several software applications specialized in procedural texture creation, most of them use a node based editor interface. The problem with those applications, of course, is that they are not free, or cheap.
-->  
有一些专业提供生成的纹理资源的软件应用程序，其中大多数使用基于节点的编辑器界面。当然，这些应用程序的问题在于它们不是免费的，也不是便宜的。  
<!--
Then is when I decided that making my own application for creating those textures would be ideal, not just to share it with other indie developers, but to learn and understand in depth all the technologies involved.  
-->  
然后我决定创造自己的应用并且去创造这些纹理将是最理想的选择，而不仅仅是与其他独立开发者分享它，而是深入学习并理解所涉及的所有技术。  
<!--
Why Unity? Because is the engine that I have been using the most, and learning how to develop my own tools for it is a critical skill, that, for sure, will be helpful in the future.
-->  
为什么是Unity?因为这是我使用最多的游戏引擎，学习如何开发自己的工具是一项重要的技能，这在未来肯定会很有帮助。  
<!--
1.2. Problem Formulation
-->  
1．2． 问题公式化  
<!--
As I have explained procedural texture generation is being used in the industry, but the main problem is that it is not accessible for indie developers, even though there are several alternatives.
-->  
正如我所解释的那样，纹理程序生成正在行业中使用，但主要问题是独立开发者无法使用它，尽管还有其他选择。  
<!--
Another problem that I have experienced is that whenever I have tried to make textures in a procedural texture software, the resulting look will vary when you try to export those texture and use them inside your game engine. Since those programs are optimized and thought to look as realistic as possible unlike game engines. Also the exporting/importing process sometimes can become tedious.
-->  
我所遇到的另一个问题是，每当我尝试着在纹理程序软件中创造纹理时，想要尝试着输出这些纹理并在游戏引擎中使用它们时，最终的外观便会发生变化。使这些程序经过了优化，看起来尽可能逼真，不像游戏引擎。此外，导出/导入过程有时也会变得乏味。  
<!--
So with my implementation I am trying to solve those issues, to make it accessible to everyone, to allow the user to see directly how it would look inside the game (since everything will be running in the same engine), and to speed up
-->  
所以在我的实现过程中，我尝试着去解决这些问题，让所有人都能够得到它，让用户能够直接看到它在游戏中的样子(因为所有内容都将在相同的引擎中运行)，并加速
